Memorable quotes or ideas:

- "ChatGPT is a stochastic parrot"
- Dogfooding: being a user of one's own products

Python language learnings:

- [PEP 701][4] in Python 3.12 allows for arbitrary code in f-strings.
  No more alternation of `""` with `''`
- Confusion of `str.lstrip` vs `str.removeprefix`
  and `str.rstrip` vs `str.removesuffix` is a huge source of bugs
- There's active development on direct integration of Python with
  web apps and mobile apps

Miscellaneous tooling findings:

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` is a standard filename for documenting architecture,
  especially architecture invariants and design boundaries
- [Structured concurrency][2] can be accomplished using [`asyncio.TaskGroup`][1]
- PyCharm's inspection tool is available independently from PyCharm
  as the tool [Qodana][3]
- PyPI is adding support for [organization accounts][5]
- [`etckeeper`][6] enables version controls for `/etc`,
  such that `apt install` or `apt upgrade` make an easily revert-able VCS commit
- The Python Packaging Authority has a tool [`cibuildwheel`][7]
  to build and test wheels for multiple platforms
- Rust's unofficial mascot Ferris the crab is cute: [Rustacean.net][8]
