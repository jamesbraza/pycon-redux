Brett Cannon is a core developer of Python,
with over 1000 commits to CPython as of June 2023.

His talk was a thought experiment:
which parts of Python 3.8 syntax are mandatory,
and which can be considered syntactic sugar?
He found 10 pieces of syntax were mandatory
(to name a few: integers, function calls + `def`, `while`, `raise`),
and [here's the full analysis][1].
The talk also reviews the Python data model in depth.
