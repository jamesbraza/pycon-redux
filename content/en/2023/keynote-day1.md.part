The author of [`coverage`][1],
Ned Batchelder is a Python community OG.
He chose to give the keynote talk on
"high uncertainty components in complex systems" (people).

This talk shares a comical perspective comparing people with software.
A few examples are people are
non-standard, undocumented, hidden state, and have unclear error messages.
It then gives an API User's Guide for people,
detailing a valuable lesson,
that all messages contain information and sentiment.

Ned also shared some advice he was given from ≈Åukasz Langa:

- If you don't say something controversial in a PyCon keynote,
  are you really living your best life?
