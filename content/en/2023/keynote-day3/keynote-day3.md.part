Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python,
came to PyCon USA 2023 and gave a talk on the history
of the many Python organization(s).
He shared many success and failure stories of conference evolution,
the ancestors of the [Python Software Foundation][1] (PSF),
and the history of PyCon itself.

A notable saying from the talk:

- Programming languages are a way to communicate ideas to other people,
  not just computers
