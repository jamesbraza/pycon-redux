Unfortunately this site's main author did not attend PyCon USA in 2024
due to recently starting a new job,
so there is no redux this time.

If you have a suggestion for a talk, saying, occurrence, etc, please
[open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/jamesbraza/pycon-redux.com/issues/new)
or make a PR into this repo adding the relevant content.
