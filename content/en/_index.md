The Python Conference (PyCon) is an amazing experience,
and one worth experiencing!

In case you couldn't make an iteration of PyCon, this website strives to assemble
worthwhile talks, wisdom, facts, and language information
from past conferences.
Content here is not a comprehensive list.
Think of it as highlights and perspective
from a single-threaded attendee's conference experience.

Hope you enjoy!
