Peter Wang co-founded Anaconda,
and gave quite a hopeful talk on the future of Python.

He described the collective motion
from client-server towards client-only compute,
while discussing [PyScript](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript),
a JavaScript competitor to run Python in HTML
backed by [WASM](https://webassembly.org/).
