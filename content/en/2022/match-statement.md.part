Brandt Bucher coauthored [PEP 634](https://peps.python.org/pep-0634/)
and gave this talk about structural pattern matching
(the `match` statement).

Notable sayings from the talk:

- Structural pattern matching is not a switch statement!
- Want practice? Implement a red-black tree with structural pattern matching
