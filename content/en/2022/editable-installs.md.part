Some background is PEP authors are required to be objective,
which can be challenging if one really believes in something.
Please read [PEP 1](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/)
for more information on what's required of PEP authors.

[PEP 660](https://peps.python.org/pep-0660/) (accepted)
and [PEP 662](https://peps.python.org/pep-0662/) (rejected)
were competing PEPs around editable installations.
Bernát Gábor, the maintainer of [`tox`](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox),
stepped up to champion PEP 662, which ultimately lost out.
Overall, this talk provides real insight into
how the Python packaging sausage gets made.
