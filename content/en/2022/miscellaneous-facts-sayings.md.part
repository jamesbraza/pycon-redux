Memorable quotes:

- "If you bash your head against a wall enough times, it becomes a pile of YAML"
- **"Duck typing paradigm: speak in terms of behaviors (not types)"**
- **"Make impossible values unrepresentable"**
- "Focus on building things that solve peopleâ€™s problems"
- **"Live and die on your engineering"**

Miscellaneous tooling findings:

- Several tools used Rust bindings for a no-GIL backend
- Typed your code?
  Compile your code to C extensions with
  [`mypyc`](https://github.com/mypyc/mypyc) for 10X speed boost
- Instagram is fully Python, both frontend and backend,
  and wrote a performance-oriented CPython 3.8-based runtime [`Cinder`][1]
- [`attrs`][2] is similar to `dataclasses`
  but has a big performance gain via `__slots__`
- [Pants build][3] intelligently caches unit tests for super fast CI
  (from [this talk](https://youtu.be/0INmW9KaAp4))
  - Think: only running relevant tests, not entire test suite
- [Semgrep][4] easily create linting rules for your domain's specifics
